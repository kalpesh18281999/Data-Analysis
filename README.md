Hotel Booking Cancellations: A Data-Driven Exploratory Analysis

Business Problem:
In recent years, both City Hotel and Resort have experienced high cancellation rates. As a result, they are facing several challenges, including reduced revenue and suboptimal room occupancy. Consequently, reducing cancellation rates has become a primary goal for both hotels to enhance their efficiency in generating revenue. Our objective is to provide comprehensive business recommendations to tackle this issue effectively.
This report focuses on analyzing hotel bookings and yearly trends, among other relevant topics, to identify the main factors contributing to the high cancellation rates. By understanding these factors, we aim to develop strategies to improve overall business performance and reduce cancellations.

Assumptions:
•	Data Reliability: No unusual occurrences between 2015 and 2017 significantly impact the data used for this analysis, ensuring its reliability.
•	Data Relevance: The information remains current and can be effectively used to analyze and plan future strategies for the hotel.
•	Current Practices: The hotels are not currently implementing any of the suggested solutions presented in this report.
•	Impact of Cancellations: Booking cancellations are the biggest factor affecting the hotel's ability to generate income efficiently.
•	Vacancy Issues: Cancellations lead to rooms remaining vacant for the duration they were initially booked, resulting in lost revenue opportunities.

Research Questions:
•	What are the variables that affect hotel reservations cancellations?
•	How can we make hotel reservations cancellation better?
•	How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?

Hypothesis:
•	More cancellations occur when prices are higher
•	When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently.
•	The majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservations
Analysis & Findings:
![cancellation Status of Bookings](https://github.com/kalpesh18281999/Data-Analysis/assets/89903875/eba9adad-7970-46d2-be71-5658c0126768)
The bar graph illustrates the distribution of reservations between those that have been canceled and those that remain active. Notably, a substantial portion of reservations are still active, despite some being canceled.

 
There are still 37% of clients who canceled their reservation, which has a significant impact on the hotels’ earnings.

 
In comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more bookings. It’s possible that resort hotels are more expensive than those in cities.

          
 

The line graph compares the average daily rates between city hotels and resort hotels over a period of time. The data reveals that while city hotel rates generally maintain a lower average, there are notable instances where resort hotel rates surpass those of city hotels. Particularly during weekends and holidays, resort hotel rates exhibit significant peaks, indicating increased demand and pricing. This fluctuation underscores the dynamic nature of hotel pricing influenced by seasonal trends and consumer preferences.


 
We have developed the grouped bar graph to analyze months with highest and lowest reservations levels according to reservation status. As it can be seen, both the number of confirmed reservations and the number of cancelled reservations are highest in the month of August whereas January is the month with highest cancelled reservations.
 
This bar graph clearly shows that cancellations tend to occur more frequently when hotel prices are higher and less frequently when prices are lower. Specifically, at the beginning of the year when hotel prices are highest, we observe a peak in cancellations. In contrast, from August onwards when prices are lower, cancellations decrease. This pattern suggests a direct relationship between accommodation costs and cancellation rates. Understanding this correlation is essential for managing reservation dynamics and pricing strategies effectively in the hospitality industry.

 
Portugal stands out as the country with the highest number of reservation cancellations.
 
Let’s check the area from where guests  are visiting the hotels and making reservations. Is it coming from Direct or Groups, Online or  Offline Travel Agents? Around 47% of the clients come from online travel agencies, whereas 20% come from offline travel agent. Only 10% of clients book hotels directly by visiting them and making reservations.

 
Around 46% of cancellation comes from online travel agencies, while 27% of cancellation comes from as group and 18% comes from offline.
 
As seen in the graph, reservations are more likely to be canceled when the average daily rate is higher. This supports the analysis that higher prices lead to increased cancellations.
